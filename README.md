# CapyStudy

# Inspiration
Studying can often feel tedious and overwhelming without a structured approach. One technique that has helped me throughout my academic journey is utilizing the Pomodoro Technique. This approach has set intervals for focused work, usually 25 minutes, followed by a short 5 minute break. We wanted to develop an app that not only helps students stay focused using this proven Pomodoro Technique but also make studying egaging with a cute, interactive AI companion, CapyBot!

# What it does
CapyStudy is a mobile app that enhances productivity by letting the user:

- Log in securely with authentication to save and track their progress through detailed session summaries.
- Set personalized study and break intervals based on the Pomodoro technique.
- Interact with an AI-powered companion for any assistance or motivation.

# How we built it
We used React Native with the Expo framework to build the app's interface, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across different devices. For the backend, we integrated Supabase for real-time data management and user authentication through Supabase Auth, allowing users to track and save their study data effortlessly. We also worked with OpenAI API for our chat bot study companion.
